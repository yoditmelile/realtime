The real-time chat web application back end is built using Node.js and MongoDB.
It allows users to send and receive messages in real-time, creating a seamless and interactive chat experience. 
The application utilizes the power of Node.js to handle incoming requests and manage the server-side logic. 
MongoDB is used as the database to store and retrieve chat messages, providing a scalable and efficient solution for data storage.
The back end also incorporates socket.io, a library that enables real-time communication between the server and the client, ensuring
that messages are instantly delivered to all connected users.
